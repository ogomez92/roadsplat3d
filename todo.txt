effects for getting hit temporary reverb
Bonuses
health (found in epic stock media one of the advanced game bonuses I think, was very good
expansion (considered a good bonus, only attainable on higher levels to expand the world back to original 80 squares)
shrink (bad bonus because it speeds everything up)
jukebox (spawns some loud music a few squares away and to the right or left). Times out after a few seconds but does not die with the tile generation.
reverse targetting
stop at objectives, but code score decrease
remove key 0 to stop (debug only)
fix spawnTime shouldn't be 0 deal
road and street proportion beeps using nearest and furthest street and road
code a scoring system
new bonus: slippery ground, slip in a random direciton when step on tile
bonus: drunken stumble, and for each beer, for the duration of the entire game you have a random percentage to trip and fall down. Set a maximum for this. Just set speed to 0 and play a sound.
