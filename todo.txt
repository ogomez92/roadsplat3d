effects for getting hit temporary reverb
Bonuses
health (found in epic stock media one of the advanced game bonuses I think, was very good
expansion (considered a good bonus, only attainable on higher levels to expand the world back to original 80 squares)
shrink (bad bonus because it speeds everything up)
jukebox (spawns some loud music a few squares away and to the right or left). Times out after a few seconds but does not die with the tile generation.
reverse targetting
stop at objectives, but code score decrease
remove key 0 to stop (debug only)
fix spawnTime shouldn't be 0 deal
